# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Based on Odin Project Exercise
This is a basic Paper, Scissors, Rock game made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Nothing fancy.
Made this myself to start testing my very rudimentary JS/CSS skills.
Surely some code can be made more efficient and there are likely plenty of potential bugs.
